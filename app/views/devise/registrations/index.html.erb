This is Index view for Users, dummy!

There will be a section 'You Are Following' which lists current_user.followees with links to "Unfollow"

Section: 'Outgoing Follow Requests' which lists current_user.requestees with links to "Cancel Request"

Section: 'Other Members' which lists current_user.others_to_request WHICH DOES NOT YET EXIST IN THE USER MODEL 

Section: 'Incoming Follow Requests' which lists current_user.requesters with links to "Accept" and "Decline"

Section: 'Your Followers' which lists current_user.followers

Also anywhere on the web site a User's name should be displayed in a standard way (styled with a certain class) AND be a clickable LINK to their profile page.
