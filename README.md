# README

This project follows The Odin Project's Rails Final Project instructions available at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project

This project uses Rails version 7.1.3.2 with Devise version 4.9.

Notes: I have not before had Devise working with a Mailer to send emails, so I have chosen not to use the 'Recoverable' module, in order that 'Confirmable' is the only module that sends emails, to confirm the creating of an account. My list of Devise modules to use is:

Database_Authenticatable, Registerable, Confirmable,
         Rememberable and Validatable.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
